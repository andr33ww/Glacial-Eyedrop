- All drawn image comparisson: https://imgur.com/a/2hyVAJb
- Glacial Eyedrop is a graphical user interface mod that tries to replace 2D arts on the game with
  manually redrawn higher resolution (4x original) version.
- Glacial Eyedrop doesn't use ai, I (andr33ww) drew all the image on top of the original
  one (scaled by times 4) pixel by pixel, with reference from the original art and original
  3d model and original cutscenes.
- The target of this mod will cover: All Character Art (Switch Menu, Junction Menu, Save and load Menu),
  All GF Art (Currently not available), All Card Art (Currently: 52 cards on works), and Card Game UI (bringback old ps1 style font with modern touch, and all
  redrawn elements, backgrounds, etc)
- This mod is still in early development, all released image might change from time to time,
  I usually review and redraw and reedit images that doesn't look or move too away from the
  original images from time to time.
- Every suggestions and donations would be so considered and much apreciated and will help me in
  develop this mod to the finish.
- Special thanks to every tsunamods team for approval, help and recommendation on developing and publishing this mod
